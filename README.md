## Overview

This repository presents a research poster summarizing and comparing four major academic studies focused on **Federated Learning (FL)** applications in **medical imaging** for privacy-preserving and generalizable model development.

The project highlights how FL enables **collaborative training** across institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. It also discusses key challenges like **non-IID data distribution** and solutions involving **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)** and **Differential Privacy (DP)**.

The goal of this work is to demonstrate how advanced FL techniques can improve diagnostic accuracy, data security, and scalability in real-world healthcare systems.
